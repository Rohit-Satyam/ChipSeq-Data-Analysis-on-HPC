## Consider the following
Some Sequences require more sequencing depth (refere [here](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/training/ChIP-Seq_Analysis/ChIP-Seq_analysis.pdf))<br/>
– ENCODE standard is ~20M reads per sample<br/>
• Can get away with fewer (K4me3 for example)<br/>
• Will need more for some marks (H3 for example)<br/>
