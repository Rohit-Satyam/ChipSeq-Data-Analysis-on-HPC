> **The number of called peaks increases with the sequencing depth, because weaker sites become statistically significant with a greater number of reads** . Although early ChIP-seq analyses produced <10 million reads per sample, it was reported that some highly active regions displayed a modest ChIP enrichment and that weak protein binding by other factors may have important subfunctions. **Therefore, deep sequencing** is required to include all functional sites. **Broad markers that cover large genomic areas require more depth than those of sharp-mode peaks**.
 
## Histone markes can be narrow and broad:<br/>

## Sufficient Sequencing depth<br/>
1. ∼20 million reads: for H3K4me3 <br/> 
2. ∼40 million: for H3K36me3 & H3K27me3 <br/>
> Based on these results, we suggest that 40–50 million reads is a practical minimum depth for human marks, except for few special cases such as H3K9me3 that cover very large contiguous domains. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4027199/)
