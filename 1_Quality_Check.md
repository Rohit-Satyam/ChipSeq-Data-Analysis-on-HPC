> **The number of called peaks increases with the sequencing depth, because weaker sites become statistically significant with a greater number of reads** . Although early ChIP-seq analyses produced <10 million reads per sample, it was reported that some highly active regions displayed a modest ChIP enrichment and that weak protein binding by other factors may have important subfunctions. **Therefore, deep sequencing** is required to include all functional sites. **Broad markers that cover large genomic areas require more depth than those of sharp-mode peaks**.
